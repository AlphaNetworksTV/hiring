## Java challenges

To run those, you just need to run `mvn test` via a terminal, or use the "run tests" features of you IDE

### Fizz-Buzz

Write a method that when called with an integer as argument, returns:

* "fizz" if the number is divisible by three
* "buzz" if the number is divisible by five
* "fizzbuzz" if the number is divisible by three AND by five
* the number, as a string if none of the above is applicable

### T9

I'm pretty sure you had a T9 phone keyboard at some point. You know, the one where you had to press twice on "2" to produce a "b" ?

In this challenge, you have to implement a T9 translator that reads an InputStream of key presses to a human-readable text.

There are many ways to implement this ... feel free to pick the one you want :-)
